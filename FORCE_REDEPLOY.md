# Force Railway Redeploy

This file forces Railway to redeploy with the latest configuration.

Timestamp: 2025-10-09 18:58:45

## Current Issue
Railway is still using `railway_api` (minimal) instead of `railway_production_api` (full features).

## Expected Behavior After Redeploy
Railway logs should show:
```
ðŸš€ Railway Enhanced Startup Script
âœ… Full annotation API available - starting production server
```

Instead of:
```
INFO:railway_api:WebSocket message received: heartbeat
```

## Debug URL
After redeploy, check: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/debug/status`
