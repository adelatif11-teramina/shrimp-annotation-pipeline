# Force Railway Redeploy

This file forces Railway to redeploy with the latest configuration.

Timestamp: 2025-10-09 19:45:00

## Latest Changes (Not Yet Deployed)
- Fixed db_password to be Optional in settings.py
- Made bulletproof API use lazy imports to avoid settings dependency
- Railway still using old cached code - forcing rebuild

## Current Issue
Railway is still using `railway_api` (minimal) instead of `railway_production_api` (full features).

## Expected Behavior After Redeploy
Railway logs should show:
```
ðŸš€ Railway Enhanced Startup Script
âœ… Full annotation API available - starting production server
```

Instead of:
```
INFO:railway_api:WebSocket message received: heartbeat
```

## Debug URL
After redeploy, check: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/debug/status`
