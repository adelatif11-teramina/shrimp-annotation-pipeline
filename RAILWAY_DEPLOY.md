## üìã Manual Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Railway Account
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (easiest option)
3. Connect your GitHub account

### Step 2: Deploy from GitHub

1. **Create New Project**:
   - Click "New Project" on Railway dashboard
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose `adelatif11-teramina/shrimp-annotation-pipeline`

2. **Railway will automatically**:
   - Detect the project as Python
   - Use the Dockerfile or nixpacks.toml configuration
   - Install dependencies
   - Build the frontend
   - Deploy the application

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, go to **Variables** and add:

**Required:**
```bash
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-jwt-secret-here
```

**Optional (but recommended):**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
ENVIRONMENT=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
```

**Generate a secure JWT secret:**
```bash
# Run this in your terminal to generate a secure secret
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

### Step 4: Deploy and Access

1. **Deploy**: Railway automatically deploys after adding environment variables
2. **Get URL**: Your app will be available at a Railway-provided URL like:
   `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
3. **Custom Domain** (optional): Add your own domain in Railway settings

## üîç Monitoring Your Deployment

### Check Deployment Status
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. View **Deployments** tab for build logs
4. View **Metrics** tab for performance

### Health Check
Your app includes a health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
```

### View Logs
In Railway dashboard:
1. Click your service
2. Go to **Logs** tab
3. See real-time application logs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Railway Features You Get

- **Auto-Deploy**: Pushes to GitHub automatically deploy
- **SSL Certificate**: HTTPS enabled by default
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, and request monitoring
- **Custom Domains**: Add your own domain
- **Database Backups**: Automatic SQLite backups
- **Rolling Deployments**: Zero-downtime updates

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails:**
- Check build logs in Railway dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

**App Won't Start:**
- Check you've set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- Review application logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify PORT environment variable is used correctly

**Database Issues:**
- SQLite is used by default (no external database needed)
- Database file persists in Railway's volume storage
- For PostgreSQL, add Railway PostgreSQL service

### Health Check Failed
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health

# Should return:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
